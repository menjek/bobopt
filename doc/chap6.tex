\chapter{Yield complex method}
Purpose of this method.

\section{Preconditions}
When optimization is discarded and rationale.

\section{Complexity tree}
What it is.

\subsection{Building complexity tree}
Code responsible for building complexity tree. Immutable.

\subsection{Heuristic}
Description of heuristic used to calculate node complexity (e.g. CPU branch prediction like heuristic and assuming common coding standards alias llvm rule "prefer early exists").

\section{Analysis of complexity tree}
Searching for places where yield should be put. Still WIP, more subsections will be coming.

\section{Behaviour in different modes}
Description of method working in different modes (diagnostic, interactive, build). I guess they are too little for subsections.
