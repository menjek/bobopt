\chapter{Bobox}
Nowadays, increasing performance comes with increasing number of computational units due to reaching to physical limits of current technologies. Parallel programming becomes more and more essential in a development of performance expensive software to use all the silicon hardware provides. A thread-based approach to achieve parallelism creates a lot of complexity for a programmer to maintain and it is also not well scalable. It becomes important to abstract underlying parallel environment to a programmer. The Bobox framework \cite{bobox} addresses this issue by providing interface for a task-based parallel programming. Apart from relieving a programmer of handling thread-based programming problems such as synchronization, the most technical details (e.g. cache hierarchy, CPU architecture) and communication, task-based programming also allows better hardware utilization.

An implementation of Bobox framework sacrifices generality to a better performance in a certain class of problems, particularly data processing problems. Without further details, under the hood, it is implemented with a fixed number of worker threads, each one with own scheduler, two task queues for every computational unit for better utilization of CPU caches, using task stealing mechanism. Communication between tasks uses column-based data model, the most significant implementation detail that favour data processing problems. Each task has zero or more inputs and zero or more outputs. Single output can be connected to zero or more inputs. A task is scheduled to be executed when it has unprocessed input.

The Bobox framework provides C++ library as an interface to its runtime environment. A task granularity is represented by classes derived from Bobox base class for a task, called \emph{box}.

\section{Design and Terminology}
An runtime environment handles implementation details of an task-based parallel environment such as scheduling and parallel execution of tasks, data transport and control flow. A programmer uses declarative way to provide an environment \emph{model} that defines the way individual tasks are interconnected. Model is used to create \emph{model instance} that is a base for creation of \emph{user request}. User request contains only a very little additional information to model instance.

After a programmer provides a user request to the environment, he has no longer control over its execution. The only possible information that can be gathered is whether runtime environment finished an execution of the request. A provided user request is divided into individual tasks. When a task is ready to be executed, it is added to a task pool. A worker thread then retrieves a task from a task pool and invokes it.

The basic element of model instance is an element representing a task called \emph{box}.  As already mentioned, every box has zero or more inputs and zero or more outputs. In every model instance, there is a special box called \emph{initialization box}. This box is responsible for a creation of initialization input data of other boxes in model. It is executed at the beginning of a request evaluation and its only goal is to send data to its only output.

Data is sent using \emph{envelope}, a column-based data structure. An empty envelope is a special type of envelope called \emph{poisoned pill}. When box receives poisoned pill on its input, it means there will be no more data sent to this input. All paths of model instances are required to end in another special type of box called \emph{termination box}. When this box receives poisoned pill, an execution is finished and a pipeline is deallocated.

\section{Boxes}
Boxes, as a representation of Bobox framework tasks, are executed in three steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The first step is \emph{prologue} when a box creates a snapshot of its inputs and stores it in member variables so user code can access it. Prologue communicates with the runtime environment and a synchronization is necessary.
\item The second step, called \emph{action}, is the main place for a user code execution. User code can communicate with the runtime environment using only specific member functions, e.g., it can send envelope to its output. This creates transparent parallel environment to a programmer relieving him from issues related to a parallel execution.
\item The last step is \emph{epilogue}. It handles scheduling of a next task based on two criteria. A task is scheduled again,

\begin{enumerate}
\item if it has got unprocessed input and it has processed some input in the action step.
\item if it requested to be scheduled again.
\end{enumerate}

The reason why box is not scheduled again if it has got unprocessed input and it has not processed any input during an execution is that it very probably waits for another input, e.g., join operation in database when a task does not execute until it has data on both inputs. The possibility to explicitly request another scheduling is there for cases when single box creates large output. It is not desired to let a task running for a long time. A task can create large output thus congest internal buffers used for a communication. Task running for a long time on a single worker thread can also create a bottleneck for a parallel execution when many other tasks wait for input from this task.

\end{enumerate}

Boxes are the main object of the interest for optimizations because they are the place for user code. Based on a static analysis of the action step, additional code can be injected to hint Bobox internal facilities with information.

\section{Usage}
\label{bobox-usage}
To implement a Bobox task, a programmer has to inherit from \code{basic\_box} base class. The action step is represented by one of the virtual member functions from the listings \ref{bobox-action-step}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Code representation of box action step.},label={bobox-action-step}]
virtual void sync_body();
virtual bool async_body(inarc_index_type inarc);
\end{lstlisting}

A programmer is expected to override one of them. A programmer can also associate names to particular inputs and outputs using helper macros from the Bobox library, which can be seen in the listings \ref{bobox-macros}. One of the implemented optimization methods identifies inputs by names.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Helper macros for mapping of names to inputs and outputs.},label={bobox-macros}]
#define BOBOX_BOX_INPUTS_LIST(...)
#define BOBOX_BOX_OUTPUTS_LIST(...)
\end{lstlisting}

Implementing a task for execution model is straightforward for a C++ programmer using only C++ core language features. Unfortunately, C++ syntax is not handy to express a definition of whole execution model. It is definitely possible, but any approach using C++ syntax could be considered inferior to an approach using different language and syntax in ease of definition and readability. The language developed to such purpose is called \emph{Bobolang} \cite{bobolang}. Example of a model definition is shown in listings \ref{bobox-bobolang}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of Bobolang usage from Bobox project.}, label={bobox-bobolang}]
model main<()><()> {
	bobox::broadcast<()><(),()> broadcast;
	Source<()><(int)> source1(odd=true), source2(odd=false);
	Merge <(int),(int)><(int)> merge;
	Sink <(int)><()> sink;
	
	input -> broadcast;
	broadcast[0] -> source1;
	broadcast[1] -> source2;
	source1 -> [left]merge;
	source2 -> [right]merge;
	merge -> sink -> output;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Problems}
Due to character of the framework scheduler, user code directly affects scheduling of tasks, thus overall performance of an execution. The framework provides ways to manipulate with a task scheduling. For example, a task can give up its execution before it finishes normally. A task can inform the scheduler that it should not be executed before all input data are available. Based on a user code analysis, such manipulation with the framework scheduler can be injected into code instead of a programmer.
